So this is the editor's office.
It's a mess.
Aya's desk and chair are here.
Aya's notebook is on the desk.
Let's see...
Oh, there's a article on Hakurei Shrine.
・・・・・・・・・
It doesn't say anything I don't know.
So you were bluffing when you said you had a big scoop.
What a waste of time and effort.
Oh, my defeated Tengu are up and trudging about.
They're coming this way with tired looks on their faces.
and They say
I'll let bygones be bygones for breaking into the youkai mountain ..
Let's all have a cup of tea together.
I'm tired too. Let's all have a tea party.

Reimu Hakurei, the lovely shrine maiden of paradise...
Enjoying sweets and tea with the Tengu and the youkai mountain.
The End
