The last time I saw Aya.
She said she had a major newspaper scoop on the Hakurei Shrine.
I don't know what she was talking about, but it smells dangerous.
I have to get the story out of the paper before her do.
I'm going to sneak into the Youkai Mountain and get rid of the newspaper's story.
If I go in from the sky, they'll know me there.
I'll have to sneak in from the mountain side.
